        <description>
            Dumps an object to a string or a text writer. Great for debugging. Awesome for capturing context in production exception dumps.

            Use ObjectPrinter.Log4Net for a renderer to automatically dump all logged exceptions using log4net.

            v2.0
            - Update framework to 4.8
            - Convert tabs to spaces

            v 1.2.5138.19225
            - replace locks in MemberCache w/ ConcurrentDictionary.
            increase lookup speed, and decrease code complexity

            v 1.2.5137.27952
            - added ShouldObscureValue and ObscureValueText: enables obscuring sensitive data.
            use Funcs.MemberContainsPassword to hide properties containing password, pwd, salt, connstring and connectionstring

            v 1.2.0 ~ BREAKING CHANGES
            - fixed centralized configs, moving all configs to Configs static class.
            - fixed bug in Funcs.IncludeType, where condition needed to be reversed.
            - share reflection cache between inspectors for lifetime of appdomain
            - add LazyDump extension method, same as Dump, but less likely to conflict with Dump methods from other assemblies.

            v 1.1.1
            - fixed bug where cached version of exception could be included in the context if ex.DumpToString()
            was called and then later the exception was output not using that extension method.

            - fixed bug where NonSerializableWrapper was being printed.  added smoke tests.
